# JucePeakSynth

----- How to Use this Plugin -----

The File Player Module:
  For this plugin to function you need to open a .wav, .aif, or aiff file for the audio player module. Once a file is selected it will loop repeatedly. The volume of the audio is controlled in decibels from -12 to 12 by the slider in this module, and the playback is controlled by the pause/play button. Additionally, the "Pause with DAW" button when toggled on will override the normal pause/play functionality, instead matching the playback state to the playhead within your DAW.

The Synth Module:
  Once a file is playing this is the module that allows you to use midi input to control the tonal nature of the sound. The gain slider controls the maximum gain level of the peak filter whenever you play a note. The Q slider controls the Q of the filter, with higher values creating a thinner peak. the Attack, Decay, Sustain, and Release knobs are standard ADSR controls which control the time it takes for the filter to reach its maximum gain and how long it takes to tail off in seconds. There is also a number of voices dropdown which allows you to determine whether the plugin is monophonic or 4-8 note polyphonic.
